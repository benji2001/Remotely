Project Title: Remotely

Built with Python3

Introduction:

The goal for remotely is to build remote access software using email, specifically email titles. The programs are relatively simple. Just like a reverse shell, their is a server and a client. Both the client and the server "log into" two seperate emails. Once the client sends a command to the server via email, the server would read the email title, and run it as a command and send the result back in the email that the client is logged in, which allows the client to read the output of the command.
